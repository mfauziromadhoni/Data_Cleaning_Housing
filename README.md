# Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on preparing a real estate dataset for further analysis by improving data quality, consistency, and structure. The process ensures that the dataset is free from unnecessary inconsistencies, duplicates, and irrelevant attributes.

## Objective
The main objective is to transform the raw dataset into a clean and well-structured format that supports accurate and efficient data analysis.

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Handle Missing Values**  
   Automatically fill missing entries with appropriate values to maintain dataset completeness.

2. **Split Address Information**  
   Separate the address field into distinct components such as street address and city to enable better filtering and aggregation.

3. **Standardize Categorical Values**  
   Convert shorthand indicators into full descriptive terms for improved clarity and readability.

4. **Remove Duplicate Records**  
   Identify and delete redundant entries to ensure uniqueness and prevent data distortion.

5. **Eliminate Irrelevant Fields**  
   Drop unused attributes to optimize storage and maintain focus on relevant information.
